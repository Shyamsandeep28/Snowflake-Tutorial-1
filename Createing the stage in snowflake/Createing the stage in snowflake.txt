 Createing the stage in snowflake
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In Snowflake, a "stage" is a virtual location that serves as an intermediary for loading data into or unloading data from the Snowflake platform. Stages can be either internal or external:

Internal Stage:
********************************
An internal stage is managed by Snowflake and is used for temporary storage of data files. It's an intermediate storage location for data being loaded into or unloaded from Snowflake.
Internal stages are typically used for short-term data storage during data import or export operations.
Internal stages are easy to create and don't require specifying a storage location since Snowflake manages them.


Creating an Internal Stage:
*********************************
Log into Snowflake: Ensure that you are logged into your Snowflake account with the appropriate privileges to create a stage.

Create the Stage: Use the CREATE STAGE statement to create an internal stage. You can specify optional parameters like file format, copy options, and encryption options.

CREATE OR REPLACE STAGE my_internal_stage;
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

External Stage:
********************************
An external stage is used to access data stored externally in cloud-based object storage services like Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage, or Google Cloud Storage.
External stages require you to specify the location and credentials to access the external data source.
They provide a way to access and query data stored outside of Snowflake without the need to physically move the data into Snowflake.

Creating an External Stage:
********************************
Log into Snowflake: Ensure that you are logged into your Snowflake account with the necessary privileges.

Create the External Stage: Use the CREATE EXTERNAL STAGE statement to create an external stage. You need to specify the URL of the external location and provide the necessary credentials to access it.

CREATE OR REPLACE EXTERNAL STAGE my_external_stage
URL = 's3://sandeep-bucket/test'
CREDENTIALS = (
  AWS_KEY_ID = '************'
  AWS_SECRET_KEY = '*************'
);
		
******Note********
Replace 's3://your-bucket/path' with the actual URL of your external storage location.
Replace 'your-access-key-id' and 'your-secret-key' with your AWS credentials for accessing the external storage.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Verify Stage Creation: To verify that your stage has been created successfully, you can use the SHOW STAGES command:

SHOW STAGES;
This command will display a list of all stages in your Snowflake account, including the one you just created.
